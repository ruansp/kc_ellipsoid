# The Kinematics of Containment for N-dimensional Ellipsoids
This article introduces the theory of the Kinematic of Containment and studies in details for the case of ellipsoids in n-dimensional Euclidean space. This theory can be applied to error estimations for parts handling tasks and robotic motion planning in challenging environment. The work has been published in the ASME Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics.

## Introduction
Knowing the set of allowable motions for a convex body moving inside a slightly larger one is of use in applications such as automated assembly mechanisms, robot motion planning, etc. The theory behind this is called the ``Kinematics of Containment (KC)'', and a simplified model of such a convex body, i.e. an ellipsoid, provides clean descriptions and efficient computational processes. This article, in particular, studies a subset of the allowable motions for an n-dimensional ellipsoid being fully contained in another. The problem is addressed in both algebraic and geometric ways, and two lower bounds of the allowable motions are proposed. Containment checking processes for a specific configuration of the moving ellipsoid and the calculations of the volume of the proposed lower bounds in configuration space (C-space) are introduced. Examples for the proposed lower bounds in 2D and 3D Euclidean space are implemented and the corresponding volumes in C-space are compared with different shapes of the ellipsoids. Practical applications using the proposed theories in motion planning problems and parts-handling mechanisms are then discussed.
